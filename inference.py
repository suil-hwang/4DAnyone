    """Generate synchronized target-view videos from one monocular video.

    Args:
        video_path: Input video; it must contain at least 121 usable frames.
        output_dir: Output directory for this clip. Defaults to data/fdanyone/<clip>.
        views_per_layer: Number of evenly spaced yaw views at each pitch.
            Total views (this number times the layer count) must be divisible by 6.
        layer_pitches: Camera pitch for each layer in degrees, for example
            [-10,15,35]. Positive values place the camera above the subject;
            each value must be between -15 and 45.
        start_yaw: First yaw in every layer, in degrees; 0 faces the person.
        yaw_span: Angular range sampled by each layer, from 1 to 360 degrees.
            The end angle is excluded so a full ring never duplicates a view.
        enable_rcp: Use six proposal views before generating more than six targets.
        enable_tcr: Shift view groups cyclically between denoising steps.
        enable_turbo: Whether to use 4DAnyone-Turbo for accelerated denoising.
            Disable it to use the base 4DAnyone model.
        model_dir: Model root; missing public checkpoints download here.
        checkpoint_path: Local 4DAnyone checkpoint override.
        mhr70_regressor_path: Local SMPL-X-to-MHR70 regressor override.
        gvhmr_root: Path to the GVHMR source checkout.
        gpu_ids: GPU IDs used for parallel pose/VAE view stages and target
            denoising. Omit to use all visible GPUs.
        attention_backend: sage2pp (default), sdpa, or auto.
            auto prefers SageAttention2++ and falls back to SDPA when unavailable.
            sageattention is a compatibility alias for sage2pp.
        target_fps: auto preserves the input clock unless it divides evenly
            to 24, 25, or 30 FPS; a positive number requests an explicit FPS.
        start_time: Clip start time on the input timeline, in seconds.
        seed: Random seed shared by proposal and target generation.
